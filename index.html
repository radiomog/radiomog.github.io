        <strong>BREAKING NEWS:</strong>
        You are wasting your incredible talents and brainpower on something that isn’t fulfilling, meaningful, or impactful. 
        Your employer doesn't care about you. You know deep inside that if you disappeared tomorrow, your team would replace you with a slide deck made by chatgpt.

          One day soon, you’ll click play and actually hear Unemployment Radio.
          For now, this is the spiritual waiting room where the punk inside you keeps whispering
          that you were never meant to clock in...

        <p>
          <strong>The Mog Hour</strong> is a 1-hour show hosted by mog:
          The Mog Hour drops every Wednesday from 4–5pm — right when you start to itch from that corporate leash around your neck and you’re debating whether to pretend to “finish one last thing.”
          It’s the inaugural and for now, the only show on Unemployment Radio. A lone hour of the week cutting through the corporate noise.
          Eventually, mog will write some words about why this whole thing exists. For now, just know it began when he stuck it to the man.
