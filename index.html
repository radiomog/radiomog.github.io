      <strong>BREAKING NEWS:</strong>
      You are spending your incredible talents and brain power on something not meaningful to you or society. 
      Your employer doesn't care about you.
      And deep down you know that if you disappeared tomorrow, your team would replace you with a slide deck and a Slack bot.

        <strong>The Mog Hour</strong> is a 1-hour show hosted by Mog:

      <p>Vibes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Half NPR, half group chat meltdown</li>
        <li>Good songs, questionable life choices</li>
        <li>For people who “left their job to figure things out” &amp; are still figuring</li>

    <a id="about"></a>
    <div class="section-title">About Unemployment Radio</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Unemployment Radio is a tiny online “station” for people who aren’t sure what their
        job title is right now: between roles, between breakdowns, between Indeed tabs.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not hustle culture. This is “I took a midday walk and then lay on the floor
        listening to music and somehow that’s my calendar for the day.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s self-aware, mildly cursed, and trying to make all this uncertainty feel a little
        more communal and a little less like you’re the only one doomscrolling job boards.
      </p>
    </div>

        Want to contribute? Want to make a show? Want to submit an unemployment story,
        layoff saga, or corporate horror anecdote? Eventually this will be the place.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, just spiritually align yourself with the unemployed and return here often.

    <div class="content">
      <div class="corp-dig">
        <strong>Have a job? Congrats, I guess.</strong><br />
        This station is:
        <ul>
          <li>For the girlies who “left to explore new paths” (aka collapsed)</li>
          <li>For the guys who used to say “circle back” unironically and are now in sweatpants</li>
          <li>For anyone who has ever written “per my last email” and meant “fight me”</li>
        </ul>
        If you’re still in corporate, you’re absolutely welcome here — just know you’re
        listening to a station run by someone whose current LinkedIn headline is basically:
        <em>“In my flop era but with taste.”</em>
